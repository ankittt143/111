<h1>COMPUTER GENRATION </H1>
<H3> FIRST COMPUTER GENRATION </H3>
<div class="header">The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently.
</div>
<h3> SECOND COMPUTER GENRATION </H3>
<div class="header">The period of second generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes.
</div>
<h3> THIRD COMPUTER GENRATION</H3>
<DIV class="header">Third-generation computers used integrated circuits in place of transistors. With the use of integrated circuits, these computers became reliable, generated less heat, were small in size, fast, very less maintenance, and were inexpensive. It was developed in 1958 by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby.</DIV>
<H3>FORTH COMPUTER GENRATION</H3>
<DIV class="header">The fourth generation lasted from 1971 to 1980.
On a single chip the width of a fingernail, thousands of components were crammed. It resulted in the invention of the microprocessor. Semiconductor memories have taken the place of magnetic core memory. During this time, computer operating institutions were designed.</DIV>
<H3>FIFTH COMPUTER GENRATION</H3>
<DIV class="header">The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date. In the fifth generation, VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components.</DIV>
